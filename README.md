# SDH-CSSThemeGenerator
A python script that generates themes for the [Steam Deck CSS Loader](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader) <br>
You get to name the theme it creates, which it conventiently puts in a seperate folder, which you can proceed to copy paste to <br> ```~/homebrew/themes/``` <br>
The script asks for several inputs: <br>
Colours are hex WITHOUT the hashtags <br>
EVERYTHING is case sensitive <br> <br>
The template picker is the full filename (there will be added more) <br>
These templates include: <br>
- regular.css which is just the regular Steam Deck UI as it normally is <br>
- classic.css which is based of [SDH-Classic by NegativeI0N](https://github.com/NegativeI0N/SDH-ClassicTheme) <br> <br>
All of the fontnames are lower-case with hyphens instead of spacebars. These can all be found in the DeckFonts.txt file. <br>
If you have custom fonts installed, these can be used too. <br> <br>
Screenshots for guiding which colours do what will follow soon.<br>
Text and Icon colours are WIP cause not all of the colours currently behave as expected. <br>
