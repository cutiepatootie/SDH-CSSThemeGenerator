# SDH-CSSThemeGenerator
A python script that generates themes for the [Steam Deck CSS Loader](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader)
The script asks for several inputs:
Colours are hex WITHOUT the hashtags
The template picker is the full filename (there will be added more)
All of the fontnames are lower-case with hyphens instead of spacebars. These can all be found in the DeckFonts.txt file. 
If you have custom fonts installed, these can be used too.
Screenshots for guiding which colours do what will follow soon.
Text and Icon colours are WIP cause not all of the colours currently behave as expected.
